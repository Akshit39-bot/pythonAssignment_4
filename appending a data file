 # Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
# 2.   Appends additional data to the same file.
# 3.   Reads and displays the final content of the file.


user_input = input("Enter some text to write in file: ")
file = open('output.txt','w')            # (open('file_name', 'w(write mode)' used to open the text file and write text into the file.)

writing_name = file.write("Hello! " + user_input + " \n")       # (file_name.write() writes the text into existing text file.)

print(writing_name)

file.close()            # (it is used to close the file.)


additional_input = input("Add some more lines to your data file: ")
file = open('output.txt','a')      # (append mode is used for writing or adding some text to the existing text file.)

writing_file = file.write(additional_input)     # (write the text into the text file.)

file.close()

file = open('output.txt','r')
reading_file = file.read()       # (file.read() is used to read the text file.)
