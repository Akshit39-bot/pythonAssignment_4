#  Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

try:           # ( try function is used to open the sample.txt file.)

    with open('sample.txt','r') as file:

        for line in file:

            print(line.strip())           # (line.strip() is used to print the lines number wise.)

              
except FileNotFoundError:              # (except is used to print another line in place of error or FileNotFoundError.)
